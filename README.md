  vector3(1695.43, 4787.8, 41.01),
  vector3(127.36, 6632.87, 30.86)
}
```

Follow the format above to add more locations. The script will automatically create the objects at these locations.

#### Locales

If you are using a locale other than English, you will need to translate the `en.lua` file, if your locale is not already included.

#### Notifications

```lua
---@param source number|string|nil The source of the player
---@param text string The text to send
---@param type string The type of notification
---@param time number|nil The time to show the notification
['Notify'] = function(source, text, type, time)
  local src = source
  local types = {['error'] = 'error', ['success'] = 'success', ['primary'] = 'primary'}
  -- Use the above table to change notify types to suit your notification resource
  if not IsDuplicityVersion() or not src then return end -- This checks whether the function is being called from the server or client
  -- ServerSide Notification
  -- local Player = duff.bridge.getplayer(src)
  -- if not Player then return end
  -- Player.showNotification(text)
  TriggerClientEvent('QBCore:Notify', src, text, types[type] or 'primary', time)
end
```

- `Notify` function, this is used to send notifications to the player. You can use this to send notifications to the player in your own way. Whether that be okok, base QB or ox_lib!
- `types` table, this is used to change the notification types to suit your notification resource. The default is set to `qb`'s notification types. To change this, simply change the value of the key to the type of notification you want to send. (ie. for okok, change `['primary'] = 'primary'` to `['primary'] = 'info'`).

#### Target

```lua
['Target'] = {
  enabled = true, -- Set to false if you don't want to use qb-target or ox_target
  distance = 1.5, -- Distance to draw the target
  icon = 'fas fa-gift' -- https://fontawesome.com/icons
}
```

- `enabled` boolean, whether to use a target system or drawtext.
- `distance` float, the distance the player has to be within to see the target.
- `icon` string, the icon to use for the target. You can find the icons [here](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
